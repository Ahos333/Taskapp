  "__comment2__": "This is one of my final projects for Woz-U and in the course we were told to use a Mock database instead of MongoDB or MySQL.",
  "__comment3__": "How database works: Any tasks that are added, edited and deleted will be reflected in this database.",

The main elements of this project are divided into componets: task-list, 
task-detail, new-task, delete-btn, button, and edit-btn

    1) Task-list: The lists of tasks (every element in the task.json file). 
    

    2) Task-detail: A page for every task in the task.json file. When
    users click on a task for click the "view" button, they are taken to 
    a different page to view that single task.

    3) New-task: All tasks added to the page as well as the task.json file.
    When the user clicks on the 'add' button, the user can see the tasks they added.
    It's also on the json file.

    4) Delete-btn: Component for deleting the task, not only from the page 
    but from the 

    5) Button: Component for each and every button of this project, for 
    every delete button, add button and edit button.

    6) Edit Button: Component for editing each task


    Also, the names of each component are not very clear or are inconsistent in the 
    project. In the future I'll have to be careful how I name the 
    components.
